Welcome to our workshop.  The goal of this project is to be able to easily share open source projects and knowledge we've learned at our shop, [Avatar New York](http://avatarnewyork.com) with other developers, designers, projects managers, digital marketers, and others.  We've broken up the content into 2 types of post through the use of `Categories`:

* Projects - open source project information
* Posts - blog posts

This project makes use of several technologies and platforms.  You can read more about them in [here](/post/jekyll_travisci_amazons3_ohmy).

## Requirements
* Amazon S3 Account
* GitHub Account
* TravisCI
* Prose.io (optional for editing)

## Setup
Most of the deployment steps below were taken from [PaperPlanes](http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/8/13/deploying-your-jekyll-blog-to-s3-with-travis-ci.html) which has a great article if your interested in some of the details.  We've added some things and made some adjustments for this project.

1. [Get JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
2. [Setup an Amazon S3 Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html)
3. Apply a public policy on your bucket to ensure NEW posts will be publicly available.

4. Create an amazon user in AMI and grant read/write access to your S3 Bucket
5. Create .travis.yml file in the root directory and modify accordingly:

```ruby
language: ruby
rvm:
  - 1.9.3
  script: bundle exec jekyll build
  install: bundle install
  after_success: bundle exec s3_website push --headless
```
